# Mcu-vs-Dcu
A box office match! Who has best performances between Mcu and Dcu? Let's find out!

In the following report, we will analyze the data coming from a statistical dataset uploaded to the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets at the following address: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/marvel-vs-dc. This dataset pertains to the comparison, at various levels, of millennial films from Marvel and DCU, two of the fundamental cinematic franchises in the HERO film universe.

The majority of the data has been extracted from the website https://www.imdb.com/, an online database containing information related to films and the cinematic world in general. However, it was necessary to diversify the sources for one of the analyzed variables. The data for this variable was sourced from the website https://www.metacritic.com/, which converts reviews about specific films (both those written by specialized critics and by ordinary private users) into numerical scores, subsequently calculating a weighted average.

We will endeavor, therefore, using mathematical and statistical tools, as well as computational support, to best synthesize the data pertaining to multiple variables and statistical units. This will enable us to achieve a more rigorous and informative overview of the entirety of the data.
